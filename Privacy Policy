Privacy Policy for Ecliso Mobile Diary App

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Ecliso ("App") handles user information and data. This policy applies to the App and all products and services offered by Ecliso.

User Data Collection
Ecliso does not collect any personal identification information or user data. We do not store any user diary entries, personal details, or other sensitive information.

Diary Entry Analysis
To provide diary entry analysis features, Ecliso utilizes the OpenAI Chat GPT API. Any text submitted by the user for analysis is securely transmitted to the API for processing. Ecliso does not store, retain, or use the analyzed data for any purpose other than generating responses to the user's diary entries.

Optional Location Tag and Attachments
Ecliso offers the option for users to add location tags to their diary entries. This feature is entirely optional, and the user has full control over whether to include this information.

Additionally, Ecliso allows users to attach photos, videos, or files from their device's camera, microphone, or files. The selection and attachment of such files are also entirely optional and under the user's control.

Data Storage and Encryption
Ecliso does not store or retain any user data, including diary entries, location tags, or attachments. All user data remains exclusively on the user's device.

Ecliso provides an optional feature to export diary entries. If a user chooses to export their data, Ecliso employs encryption measures to protect the exported file. However, it is important to note that encryption is optional and can be disabled by the user.

Third-Party Services
Ecliso does not share any user data with third parties. We do not engage in data sharing, selling, or renting of any kind.

Children's Privacy
Ecliso does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us, and we will take appropriate steps to remove such information from our records.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
Ecliso reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in an updated policy version with a revised date. It is recommended that users review this policy periodically for any modifications.
